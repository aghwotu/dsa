### Daily Coding Problem #2

```text
Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Uber.

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

Follow-up: what if you can't use division?

### Solution #2 - Javascript

```typescript
function productExceptSelf(nums: number[]): number[] {
  let arrayLength = nums.length;
  let result = [];

  // loop forwards to get the prefix values
  // 0 ==> 1 ==> 2 ==> 3
  // result = [1, 1, 2, 6]
  let prefixMultiplier = 1;
  for (let i = 0; i < arrayLength; i++) {
    result[i] = prefixMultiplier;
    prefixMultiplier *= nums[i];
  }

  // now, loop backwards through the array
  // 3 ==> 2 ==> 1 ==> 0
  // then multiply the postfix values with the prefix values already stored
  // in 'result'

  let postfixMultiplier = 1;
  for (let i = arrayLength - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    result[i] *= postfixMultiplier;
    postfixMultiplier *= nums[i];
  }

  return result;
}
```
